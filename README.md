# A Study of 10,000 Pornstars 
In 2013, Jon Millward published the first ever study on pornstars with data extracted from Internet Adult Film Database (IAFD). You know, the love of data can lead us to discover various parts of the world without ever experiencing them ourselves. Sharing the same interest, my second analysis looks deeper into pornstars’ careers by not only discovering what a typical Pornhub star looks like but also what separates top and low performers.  

Out of curiosity, I used Beautiful Soup to scrape profiles of exactly 11,395 female pornstars on Pornhub, which include not just professional actresses but also models and amateur content creators. To examine what makes a pornstar successful requires us to define a success metric (dependent variable Y) and a set of explanatory features (independent variables X’s). Pornhub is much like a pornographic YouTube and each pornstar has ther own channel with her bio details published on top of the page. So, I used Subscribers as Y against which to examine the relationships with the 21 feature X’s I managed to extract.
