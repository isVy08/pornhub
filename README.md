# A Study of 10,000 Pornstars 
In 2013, Jon Millward published the <a href=https://jonmillward.com/blog/studies/deep-inside-a-study-of-10000-porn-stars/>first ever study</a> on pornstars with data extracted from Internet Adult Film Database (IAFD). The love of data can lead us to discover various parts of the world without ever experiencing them ourselves. With the same interest, my analysis dives deeper into pornstarsâ€™ careers by not only discovering what a typical Pornhub star looks like but also what separates top and low performers.  

Using Beautiful Soup, I crawled the Pornhub profiles of exactly 11,395 female pornstars, including professional actresses, models and amateur content creators. Pornhub is much like a pornographic YouTube where pornstars have ther own channel with bio details published on top of the page. With the objective to explore what makes a pornstar successful, I used the number of subscribers as a proxy to measure the popularity of a pornstar, and examined the correlations between the channel subscribers with the 21 different profile features.
